This project now primarily targets the [European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI)](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EBSI/Home).

We aim to provide a backend wallet infrastructure for issuer, holder, verifier for EBSI conformant verifiable credentials. 
The next major milestone is to pass the [EBSI Wallet Conformance](https://hub.ebsi.eu/wallet-conformance) testsuite.   

Once we have an EBSI compliant infrastructure, we can think about whether/how we can integrate that with [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) and
hence offer our large user/customer base an important additional piece of functionality for their integration tasks.

Our greater vision is, that integration endpoints can have "Trust over IP" by using standard verifiable credentials.
