    <h2>Use Case: International Travel with Minor</h2>

        <div style="padding-left:20px">
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/#international-travel-with-minor-and-upgrade" target="_blank">https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases</a>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
            Malathi is traveling internationally with her 8-month-old son, Anand. His father, Rajesh, is staying home.
            Malathi has enough frequent flyer miles to upgrade the ticket to first class.

            <h3>Distinction</h3>
            <p>
            This use case is difficult because:
            <ul>
                <li>Current US passports do not establish explicit relationship between parent and child.
                <li>When one parent travels with a minor, the other parent is required to grant permission for the trip, thus implying guardianship or responsibility.
                <li>The DID or other Digital Identity system replaces the role of the notary in the paper/physical world.
                <li>Credentials must be coordinated between two verifiers (agent and airline) for two individuals, and a digital coupon is used.
                <li>The relationship of the minor to the non-traveling parent must be established, in order for the permission to be considered.
                <li>In the minor's passport case, the subject is not the holder of the verifiable credential. The holder of the passport is a parent, not the minor.
            </ul>

            <h3>Scenario</h3>
            <p>
            Malathi obtains permission from Rajesh stating she is allowed to take the baby out of the country.
            <p>
            Prior to booking the trips, Malathi visits HappyAir.com to request an upgrade to first class. HappyAir issues a verifiable credential redeemable for a first class upgrade on an international flight.
            <p>
            She books the plane tickets through her travel agent who adds the lap child to the ticket.
            <p>
            HappyAir verifies that Malathi has a signed statement from Anand's other parent stating that she may exit the country with him.
