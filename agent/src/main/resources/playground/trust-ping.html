    <h2>Trust Ping</h2>

    Trust ping is an integral part of establishing a peer connection. It is also useful if we want to verify that the connection we
    have with other party is still active.<br>
    Keys might have been rotated or endpoints migrated to other locations. Some Did methods support such changes transparently, others don't.
    Here we show how we can issue an explicit trust ping.

    <div>
    <pre>
        <code>
        Nessus DIDComm CLI
        Version: ${version}

        >> agent start

        >> wallet create --name Malathi

        Malathi>> protocol invitation receive --inviter=Government --url=http://${Host}/message/invitation?inviter=Government&method=${method}

        Malathi>> protocol trust-ping send

        Malathi>> message list
        </code>
